## The House of Representatives building, as a cornerstone of democratic governance, is particularly vulnerable to cyber threats. This research endeavors to fortify the defenses against such threats through the amalgamation of a physical security system comprising Vicon sensors and facial recognition cameras, coupled with the analysis of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data, culminating in the development of a robust and all-encompassing Cyber-Physical System (CPS).In the practical implementation of this system, Vicon sensors meticulously capture the physical movements within the House of Representatives building from multiple points and angles. Subsequently, cloud computing is employed to scrutinize the sensor data, providing an initial assessment of an individual's behavior as either aggressive or normal.Simultaneously, surveillance cameras strategically positioned throughout the building focus on collecting facial features. These specialized cameras transmit images to an intelligent system that leverages cognitive computing for the final judgment on an individual's behavior. This two-pronged approach, integrating physical movement analysis and facial feature recognition, enhances the system's accuracy in behavioral assessment.To harmonize the cyber (computing and communication) and physical (sensors, actuators, and processes components)communication and routing protocols are monitored closely. This entails the examination of the BGP protocol, a border gateway protocol responsible for dynamically managing data and controlling routing and communication protocols. Cognitive computing is employed in this context to identify and categorize cyber attacks on the network infrastructure surrounding the House of Representatives building.By integrating and analyzing BGP data within the CPS, a comprehensive understanding of both physical and network security is achieved. This integrated CPS system stands poised to provide accurate and layered protection for the House of Representatives, encompassing both the physical and cyber dimensions of security.
